# Message queue/broker
### how to set up a message broker using RabbitMQ and docker

we will be using various technologies
> * docker
> * RabbitMQ
> * Python and the library Pika 

Here we assume you already have **docker** installed. we will use one of the las RabbitMQ docker container versions, if you need managment or not alpine version feel free to change it you can check out other verions in the DockerHub official image: https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq  the version in this project is [4.0-rc-alpine](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq/blob/8049e562768aa2f2ff8b3b84e03cd111cd212ba2/4.0-rc/alpine/Dockerfile).

In the docker file we set some parameters ot use in the managmen mode given by RabbitMQ `ENV RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=admin` and `ENV RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=password` if they are not set before building, both will be `ENV RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest` and `ENV RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest` as a good practice, they are chaged here.

Also a `VOLUME` is set up in our **Dockerfile**, to make the messages persistent while transactions.

As you will see in the root of this project is a *scripts* folder, those examples are used to test, they were just took from the [RabbitMQ docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials), to be able to execute them u need to install [**pika**](https://pypi.org/project/pika/) from the docs or just use the command given by RabbitMQ docs:
```
python -m pip install pika --upgrade
```
You can go pick to install this globaly or as we did, inside a virtual enviroment as a good practice in case you will not reuse that library again or to avoid versions issues, 
#### venv instructions
```
python -m venv myenv
```
change the `myenv` as you prefer
```
source .myenv/bin/activate
```
now you can work in you root folder, as a tip once you finish you just deactivate it `deactivate` in you terminal

## docker build

inside you root you need to build and run 
```
docker build -t yourDockerImage .
docker run -d --name rabbit-containerName -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 youDockerImage
```
**Congratss** you  have your own message brocker inside a Docker container.
To make use of it, go to `localhost:15672` there you will see the managmen set up given by RabbitMQ, now if you run the scripts they will be communicating one to another
```
python client.py
python publisher.py
```
the output in the client should be something like this 
```
